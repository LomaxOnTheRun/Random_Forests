#Decision trees

These are 'trees' made of a single root node, which splits into two or more branches based on an attribute of the population in the root node. These branches then further split using other attributes. This continues until a condition is met, usually that there is a maximum population left in a node. This maximum population would be 1 for a completely sorted total population.
